VibeVoice is a novel framework designed for generating **expressive**, **long-form**, **multi-speaker** conversational audio, such as podcasts, from text. It addresses significant challenges in traditional Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems, particularly in scalability, speaker consistency, and natural turn-taking.

A core innovation of VibeVoice is its use of continuous speech tokenizers (Acoustic and Semantic) operating at an ultra-low frame rate of 7.5 Hz. These tokenizers efficiently preserve audio fidelity while significantly boosting computational efficiency for processing long sequences. VibeVoice employs a [next-token diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08635) framework, leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) to understand textual context and dialogue flow, and a diffusion head to generate high-fidelity acoustic details.

The model can synthesize speech up to **90 minutes** long with up to **4 distinct speakers**, surpassing the typical 1-2 speaker limits of many prior models.

## Apple Silicon (MPS) Support

VibeVoice has full support for Apple Silicon Macs using the Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) backend. Here's what you need to know:

### MPS Configuration and Optimization

VibeVoice automatically detects and configures the optimal settings for MPS:

1. **BFloat16 Preference**: VibeVoice prefers BFloat16 precision on MPS for best performance, with automatic fallback to Float16 if needed.
2. **Attention Implementation**: Uses Scaled Dot Product Attention (SDPA) on MPS. Flash Attention is only available for CUDA and is not used on MPS.
3. **Environment Setup**: VibeVoice automatically sets the required environment variables:
   - `PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1` - Enables fallback operations for unsupported MPS operations
   - `PYTORCH_MPS_HIGH_WATERMARK_RATIO=0.0` - Optimizes memory management on MPS

If you prefer to set these manually in your shell, add these lines to your `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
export PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1
export PYTORCH_MPS_HIGH_WATERMARK_RATIO=0.0
```

### Performance Considerations

When running on Apple Silicon, keep these points in mind:

1. **Timing Variance**: MPS timings can have higher variance compared to CUDA due to the unified memory architecture. For benchmarking, it's recommended to run multiple tests and use the median result.
2. **Unified Memory**: MPS uses unified memory (shared with system RAM) rather than dedicated VRAM. This can affect memory reporting and allocation patterns.
3. **Optimal Performance**: For best performance on Apple Silicon, use the 7B model variant which is more stable and optimized.

### Quick Start Commands

Here are common usage patterns:

```bash
# Basic inference with automatic device detection
python demo/inference.py \
  --model_path WestZhang/VibeVoice-Large-pt \
  --txt_path demo/text_examples/1p_abs.txt \
  --speaker_names Alice

# Multiple speakers
python demo/inference.py \
  --model_path WestZhang/VibeVoice-Large-pt \
  --txt_path demo/text_examples/2p_music.txt \
  --speaker_names Alice Yunfan

# Explicitly specify device
python demo/inference.py \
  --model_path WestZhang/VibeVoice-Large-pt \
  --txt_path demo/text_examples/2p_music.txt \
  --speaker_names Alice Yunfan \
  --device mps

# Specify BFloat16 precision (automatically selected on MPS when supported)
python demo/inference.py \
  --model_path WestZhang/VibeVoice-Large-pt \
  --txt_path demo/text_examples/1p_abs.txt \
  --speaker_names Alice \
  --dtype bf16

# Direct text input instead of file
python demo/inference.py \
  --model_path WestZhang/VibeVoice-Large-pt \
  --txt $'Speaker 1: Hello, how are you?\nSpeaker 2: Hello, what a pleasant surprise!' \
  --speaker_names Alice Samuel

# Launch Gradio demo
python demo/gradio_demo.py \
  --model_path WestZhang/VibeVoice-Large-pt \
  --share
```

### Diagnostic and Benchmark Tools

VibeVoice includes utilities to help diagnose and benchmark your MPS setup:

1. **MPS Diagnostic Tool**: Check your MPS setup and compatibility
   ```bash
   python -m vibevoice.utils.mps_diagnose
   ```

2. **Performance Benchmark**: Measure inference performance on your device
   ```bash
   python -m vibevoice.scripts.benchmark_mps
   ```

### CLI Flags

The inference script supports these flags:

- `--model_path`: Path to the HuggingFace model directory (default: "microsoft/VibeVoice-1.5b")
- `--txt`: Direct text input for inference (instead of reading from a file)
- `--txt_path`: Path to the txt file containing the script (required if --txt is not provided)
- `--speaker_names`: Speaker names in order (e.g., --speaker_names Andrew Ava "Bill Gates")
- `--output_dir`: Directory to save output audio files (default: "./outputs")
- `--device`: Specify the computation device (`auto`, `cuda`, `mps`, `cpu`) - defaults to `auto`
- `--dtype`: Specify the data type (`auto`, `bf16`, `fp16`, `fp32`) - defaults to `auto`
- `--attn-impl`: Specify attention implementation (`auto`, `flash_attention_2`, `sdpa`) - defaults to `auto`
- `--cfg_scale`: CFG (Classifier-Free Guidance) scale for generation (default: 1.3)
- `--probe-only`: Print resolved device/dtype/attn configuration and exit without loading model
- `--no-compile`: Disable torch.compile() and run in eager mode. By default, the model runs in compiled mode for significantly faster inference on supported hardware (CUDA and MPS). The first run will have a one-time compilation overhead.

Note: Flash Attention is only available on CUDA devices. On MPS, SDPA is automatically used.

### Performance Optimization

VibeVoice runs in compiled mode by default for significantly faster inference on supported hardware (CUDA and MPS). The first run will have a one-time compilation overhead, but subsequent runs will be much faster. If you encounter any issues with the compiled mode, you can use the `--no-compile` flag to run in eager mode.

## Usages

### 🚨 Tips
We observed users may encounter occasional instability when synthesizing Chinese speech. We recommend:

- Using English punctuation even for Chinese text, preferably only commas and periods.
- Using the 7B model variant, which is considerably more stable.

### Usage 1: Launch Gradio demo
```bash
apt update && apt install ffmpeg -y # for demo

# For 1.5B model
python demo/gradio_demo.py --model_path microsoft/VibeVoice-1.5B --share

# For 7B model
python demo/gradio_demo.py --model_path WestZhang/VibeVoice-Large-pt --share
```

### Usage 2: Inference from files or direct text input

The script expects text input in a specific format where each speaker line starts with "Speaker X:" where X is a number:

```
Speaker 1: Hello, how are you today?
Speaker 2: I'm doing great, thanks for asking!
Speaker 1: That's wonderful to hear.
```

You can provide this text in two ways:

1. Via a text file using `--txt_path`
2. Directly as a string using `--txt`

```bash
# We provide some LLM generated example scripts under demo/text_examples/ for demo
# 1 speaker
python demo/inference.py --model_path WestZhang/VibeVoice-Large-pt --txt_path demo/text_examples/1p_abs.txt --speaker_names Alice

# or more speakers
python demo/inference.py --model_path WestZhang/VibeVoice-Large-pt --txt_path demo/text_examples/2p_music.txt --speaker_names Alice Frank

# Direct text input (instead of file)
python demo/inference.py --model_path WestZhang/VibeVoice-Large-pt --txt "Speaker 1: Hello, how are you today? Speaker 2: I'm doing great, thanks for asking!" --speaker_names Alice Frank
```

The `--speaker_names` parameter maps speaker numbers to actual names. For example, with `--speaker_names Alice Frank`, Speaker 1 will use Alice's voice and Speaker 2 will use Frank's voice.

## FAQ
#### Q1: Is this a pretrained model?
**A:** Yes, it's a pretrained model without any post-training or benchmark-specific optimizations. In a way, this makes VibeVoice very versatile and fun to use.

#### Q2: Randomly trigger Sounds / Music / BGM.
**A:** As you can see from our demo page, the background music or sounds are spontaneous. This means we can't directly control whether they are generated or not. The model is content-aware, and these sounds are triggered based on the input text and the chosen voice prompt.

Here are a few things we've noticed:
*   If the voice prompt you use contains background music, the generated speech is more likely to have it as well. (The 7B model is quite stable and effective at this—give it a try on the demo!)
*   If the voice prompt is clean (no BGM), but the input text includes introductory words or phrases like "Welcome to," "Hello," or "However," background music might still appear.
*   Spekaer voice related, using "Alice" results in random BGM than others.
*   In other scenarios, the 7B model is more stable and has a lower probability of generating unexpected background music.

In fact, we intentionally decided not to denoise our training data because we think it's an interesting feature for BGM to show up at just the right moment. You can think of it as a little easter egg we left for you.

#### Q3: Text normalization?
**A:** We don't perform any text normalization during training or inference. Our philosophy is that a large language model should be able to handle complex user inputs on its own. However, due to the nature of the training data, you might still run into some corner cases.

#### Q4: Singing Capability.
**A:** Our training data **doesn't contain any music data**. The ability to sing is an emergent capability of the model (which is why it might sound off-key, even on a famous song like 'See You Again'). (The 7B model is more likely to exhibit this than the 1.5B).

#### Q5: Some Chinese pronunciation errors.
**A:** The volume of Chinese data in our training set is significantly smaller than the English data. Additionally, certain special characters (e.g., Chinese quotation marks) may occasionally cause pronunciation issues.

#### Q6: Instability of cross-lingual transfer.
**A:** The model does exhibit strong cross-lingual transfer capabilities, including the preservation of accents, but its performance can be instable. This is an emergent ability of the model that we have not specifically optimized. It's possible that a satisfactory result can be achieved through repeated sampling.

## Risks and limitations

While efforts have been made to optimize it through various techniques, it may still produce outputs that are unexpected, biased, or inaccurate. VibeVoice inherits any biases, errors, or omissions produced by its base model (specifically, Qwen2.5 1.5b in this release).
Potential for Deepfakes and Disinformation: High-quality synthetic speech can be misused to create convincing fake audio content for impersonation, fraud, or spreading disinformation. Users must ensure transcripts are reliable, check content accuracy, and avoid using generated content in misleading ways. Users are expected to use the generated content and to deploy the models in a lawful manner, in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions. It is best practice to disclose the use of AI when sharing AI-generated content.

English and Chinese only: Transcripts in languages other than English or Chinese may result in unexpected audio outputs.

Non-Speech Audio: The model focuses solely on speech synthesis and does not handle background noise, music, or other sound effects.

Overlapping Speech: The current model does not explicitly model or generate overlapping speech segments in conversations.

We do not recommend using VibeVoice in commercial or real-world applications without further testing and development. This model is intended for research and development purposes only. Please use responsibly.
